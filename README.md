**Brief Description of the Code**

This application is designed to perform network diagnostics by executing ping and speed tests. It utilizes Django as the backend framework and provides a user-friendly web interface. Key features include:

**  Ping Results**:
Measures packet loss, average ping time, jitter, source IP, and destination IP. Results are displayed in a dedicated box, with each metric presented in separate rectangles.

** Speed Test Results:**
Measures download and upload speeds using circular meters for visualization, along with server latency and location information.

**Dynamic Interaction:**
The frontend uses AJAX to submit requests and update results without refreshing the page, providing a seamless user experience.

**Django Description**

  This Django application is built to perform network diagnostics through ping and speed tests. It includes the following components:
  
  **View Function (ping_view):**
  Handles GET and POST requests, processes user input from a form, and returns results as a JSON response.
  
  ** Form Handling (PingForm):**
  Validates user input (target IP or hostname) to ensure proper format.
  
  ** Ping Functionality (send_icmp_echo):**
  Implements ICMP echo requests to measure network latency and packet loss.
  
  ** Jitter Calculation (calculate_jitter):**
  Computes jitter based on the collected latency measurements.
  
  **Speed Test Functionality (perform_speed_test):**
  Utilizes the speedtest library to measure internet speeds.
  
  **Error Handling:**
  Manages scenarios where the target cannot be resolved.
